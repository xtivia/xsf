##Using the Xtivia Services Framework (XSF) to Create REST Services in Liferay

XSF is a framework that Xtivia has created (and used for multiple client engagements) that enables the rapid development of custom REST services in Liferay. REST services developed using XSF are coded in a fashion similar to JAX-RS or Jersey but can take advantages of Liferay features such as roles/permissions.

###Documentation

The full documentation for XSF can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtivia/xsf/master/userguide.pdf). 

###Sample XSF Application

As the documentation describes XSF is currently available as Maven artifacts from Maven Central, including both the main JAR as well as an archetype that can be used for building XSF-based applications (these are deployed as Liferay portlet plugins). This distribution provides an as-generated example of an application/plugin that was previously generated using the XSF archetype.

The download here can then serve as a quick starting point for XSF experimentation. Please refer to the XSF documentation (see link above for more details).
